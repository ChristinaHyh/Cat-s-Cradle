<h2 style="text-align:center">You and Me</h2><br>

<h6 style="text-align:center">
<br>
With a fanciful paintbrush,<br><br>


I weave you into my verse.<br><br>

A hundred poems, a hundred you.<br><br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

With an ink-leaking pen,<br><br>

I draw the sheep into the box.<br><br>

You would definitely fancy it, as I do.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

But ala, you cannot see,<br><br>

A hundred of you,<br><br>

And the sheep inside. </h6>
