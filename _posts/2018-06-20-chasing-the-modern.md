Glad to have the opportunity to participate in the book sharing event for Mr. Tony S. Hsu's new book, *Chasing the Modern*. After reading, I was captivated by Mr. Hsu Chih-mo's writing and talents again. It reminded me of the date with poetry. I have been studying in Beijing for three years.  With a different feeling arose spontaneously, lots of thoughts sprang up. So I picked up my pen to write down.

<h2 style="text-align:center">Chasing The Light</h2><br>

<h6 style="text-align:center">
<br>
Yearning, yearning for the sparkle of neon lights outside,<br><br>


The Brave mounts his lame blind horse.<br><br>

In pursuit, in pursuit——<br><br>

<br>

<br>

Habituating, habituating to the flickering campfire at night,<br><br>

People gather round with hoarse tired expressions.<br><br>

Frittering away, frittering away——<br><br>

<br>

<br>

I wander among the chaotic crowds,<br>

<br>

Followers of The Brave come towards me:<br>

<br>

"Why don't you chase that sparkling neon lights? <br>

<br>

Are you content with just this dim fire?"<br>

<br>

Why in rush?  Why to chase?<br>

<br>

I close my eyes and I see the stars.
