Don't invert the ice cream on my book<br><br>

Nor use that vacuum cleaner<br><br>

to suck away the cloud that fascinates me<br><br>

Don't pick the wildflowers by the roadside<br><br>

Nor take away those flowers<br><br>

that make people stop and savor<br><br>

to make flower arrangement in a vase</h6><br>
